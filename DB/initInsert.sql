(1, 1, 2, "Don't hit this one too hard! Keep your ball to the left and it'll curve back to the hole."),
(1, 2, 2, "Get up the hill!! Hit it hard enough over the hill and aim straight for the hole."),
(1, 3, 2, "Yay, another hill! Aim for the whole with enough strength to get over the hill but don't over shoot!"),
(1, 4, 3, "Okay, go for the front hole and aim lightly. Even if you miss, the second shot isn't difficult."),
(1, 5, 2, "Not sure how this is a par 2... Give it a strong smack and hopefully you get a good roll over that ledge."),
(1, 6, 2, "This is a hard hole to get in one. Aim for under the octopus to try for an ace or lightly tap your shot to the left for an easy 2."),
(1, 7, 2, "Did the cannon ball spray get you? For this one, start at the right of the tee box and aim to the left of the hole. Shoot lightly!"),
(1, 8, 2, "Go for the ridge or go left, either way, if you get a hole in one here YOU GOT LUCKY!"),
(1, 9, 2, "Up the right side, down the left side, back to the hole. A lucky shot gets the hole in one."),
(1, 10, 2, "Go left or go right, each side gets its own hole. Good power and a lucky bounce for the Ace."),
(1, 11, 2, "The hole is protected so a hole in one is almost impossible. Go for 2."),
(1, 12, 3, "We're looking for 2 here. Aim left lightly then your next shot is a bank shot off the right side of the bridge."),
(1, 13, 2, "Go right?"),
(1, 14, 2, "Go right and hope for a good roll or go very lightly directly at the hole. Your choice!"),
(1, 15, 2, "Shoot up the hill with power and aim straight! The hole is directly in the middle up top."),
(1, 16, 2, "So there are some goofy little hills by the hole. Aim off the slanted wall in front of you and hope for a good bounce."),
(1, 17, 3, "Play the hill on the right and the ball should curve towards the hole on the left."),
(1, 18, 2, "Not too hard, not too soft. Good luck!"),
(2, 1, 2, "With medium speed, aim for the cement walkway so the ball rebounds towards the hole."),
(2, 2, 2, "You can make it through the totem pole if you keep your shot as right as possible and definitely don't shoot hard."),
(2, 3, 2, "Left is more fun, but if you are precise, the hole in one might be easier straight on."),
(2, 4, 2, "Give it good power and bank it off the tall wall in front of you."),
(2, 5, 3, "Doesn't matter which side you choose, a hole in one is all about luck here."),
(2, 6, 2, "Tee up to the right and aim through the small opening with medium speed."),
(2, 7, 2, "With medium speed, bank off the cement towards the hole. Not too fast though!"),
(2, 8, 2, "I think you already know what to do here. Good luck!"),
(2, 9, 2, "Watch out for the sloping green!"),
(2, 10, 2, "This is the practice hole for #18. Your ball might get stuck unfortunately. Don't move the rock, please."),
(2, 11, 2, "Try and hit the wall to the left so it hits the right wall next and rolls to the hole."),
(2, 12, 2, "Stay to the right and bounce your shot off the left side of the far wall."),
(2, 13, 3, "Strong shot up the hill. There are two holes so aim for either side."),
(2, 14, 2, "Medium speed and aim left. The green slopes towards the water."),
(2, 15, 3, "I always shoot under the bridge. Your call though."),
(2, 16, 2, "There is a small chance of your ball getting stuck if you go under."),
(2, 17, 2, "Jump it!! Lucky bounces are your bestfriend here."),
(2, 18, 2, "Not too hard, not too soft. Good luck!");
